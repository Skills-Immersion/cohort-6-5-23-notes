// allows you to do things like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)

// Fundamentally, How Tests Work
// 1. Figure out which code I'm trying to test & think about what different cases I want to test
// 2. For each case that I want to test:
//    2.a Set up the data that I'm going to input
//    2.b Run the code with that input
//    2.c Check that the code worked right (assertions)
