// Given an array of numbers, find the largest product formed by two of the numbers. For example, 
// if the input array is [1, 5, 3, 4, 2,], the largest product that can be formed by two of the numbers is 20, 
// which is the product of 5 and 4. Can you write code to solve this problem?

// will it have dupe numbers -> there can be
// what happens if you get an empty array -> throw me an error check if there is only 2
// will there be neg nums -> yes still give largest product
