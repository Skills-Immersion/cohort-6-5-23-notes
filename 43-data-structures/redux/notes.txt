Redux is a state management library for Javascript apps
Can be used with REACT or Vanilla Javascript

Redux provides a single source of truth for application state, making it easier to manage and predict state changes

there are three main core concepts to the Redux architecture
ACTIONS STORE REDUCER

[Action] --dispatched to--> [Store]
    ^                           |
    |                           | 
    |                           v
[Reducers] <---- updates ---- [State]

Action: A plain JavaScript object representing what happened and what needs to change. It's the only source of information for the store.
Store: The central location where the application's state is stored. It dispatches actions to reducers.
Reducers: Functions that determine how the state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
State: The single source of truth in the application, representing its current state. It is updated based on the actions processed by reducers.
